The script is a keylogger that captures keystrokes on a system using the
pynput.keyboard library. It logs the keystrokes into a string, resets the log every 120
seconds, and sends it via email to the specified address (email@gmail.com) using
the smtplib library and Gmail's SMTP server. The process runs continuously in
the background using threading until manually stopped.
Here’s a concise guide on how to use the keylogger script in a Kali Linux
environment, assuming the script is already saved as keylogger.py with an email and
password configured.
• Install Dependencies:
o Ensure Python 3 is installed: sudo apt install python3.
o Install pynput: pip3 install pynput.
• Configure Gmail SMTP:
o Enable 2FA in your Google Account.
o Generate an App Password under "Security" > "App passwords".
o Update the script with the App Password: nano keylogger.py, edit the
password in my_keylogger = Keylogger(120, "email@gmail.com",
"app-password-here").
• Make the Script Executable:
o Run: chmod +x keylogger.py.
• Run the Script:
o Execute: python3 keylogger.py (or sudo python3 keylogger.py if
permission issues arise).
o The script captures keystrokes and emails the log to email@gmail.com
every 120 seconds.
• Test the Keylogger:


o Type text in another window (e.g., “Testing in Kali”).
o Check your email after 120 seconds for the log.
• Stop the Script:
o Press Ctrl + C in the terminal to stop the script.
o If running in the background, find the PID (ps aux | grep keylogger.py)
and terminate: kill -9 <PID>.
