# How to Install and Use the Python Keylogger

This guide will help you set up, configure, and run the Python keylogger that captures keystrokes and sends logs via email.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your system ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))  
- Internet connection for sending email via SMTP  
- A Gmail account (or any SMTP-enabled email) for sending logs  
- Basic familiarity with running commands in a terminal or command prompt  

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
https://github.com/ar-sijan-official/Python-Keylogger
cd python-keylogger

Install Required Python Packages
Install the pynput package used for capturing keyboard input:
pip install pynput


Configure Email Settings:
Open the keylogger.py file in a text editor and locate this section at the bottom:

my_keylogger = Keylogger(
    time_interval=120,                   # Time in seconds between sending logs
    email="your_email@gmail.com",       # Replace with your email address
    password="your_email_password"      # Replace with your email password or app password
)
Replace "your_email@gmail.com" with your actual sender email address.

Replace "your_email_password" with your email password.

For Gmail accounts, it is recommended to use an App Password instead of your main password.

Run the Keylogger
To start the keylogger, run this command in your terminal:

python keylogger.py
The script will begin recording keystrokes silently and send the logs to your configured email every 2 minutes (120 seconds). You can change the interval in seconds by editing the time_interval parameter.
